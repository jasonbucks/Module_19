# Module_19 - Blockchain Wallets

![Blockchain Wallet](Images/19-4-challenge-image.png)

I work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finderâ€™s lead developer, I have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable our customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

In this Challenge, I will complete the code that enables our customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, I will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.9.12 with the following packages:

* [web3](https://pypi.org/project/web3/) - This Python library is used to interact with Ethereum

* [bip44](https://pypi.org/project/bip44/) - Simple Python bip44 implementation. Mnemonic + bip32

* [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Allows the python application to be deployable as a shareable web app

* [ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) - Quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates

---

## Installation Guide

First install the required libraries:

```console
  pip install web3
  pip install streamlit
  pip install bip44
```

Additionally, the Ganache application will have to be downloaded and installed on your machine.

Before running the application first import the following libraries and dependencies:

```python
  import streamlit as st
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  from typing import Any, List
  from web3 import Web3
  import os
  import requests
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  load_dotenv()
  from bip44 import Wallet
  from web3 import Account
  from web3 import middleware
  from web3.gas_strategies.time_based import medium_gas_price_strategy
  from crypto_wallet import generate_account, get_balance, send_transaction
```

---

## Usage

On your command line interface, navigate to the directory that contains this python file, then execute the following command:

```console
streamlit run fintech_finder.py
```

### Ganache Starting Balances

I edited the starter code so that the 4 fintech professionals use the account addresses for indexes 1 through 4.  This makes it easy to verify that the ether was transferred to the correct account, but these account addresses will need to be updated everytime a new Ganache workspace is used.

### Streamlit "Send Transaction" Screenshots

I ended up hiring all 4 candidates!  40 hours for Lane, 30 hours for Ash, 20 hours for Jo and 10 hours for Kendall.

### Ganache - Final Account Balances, Blocks Mined and Transaction History

Lane is Account Index 1, as well as the first Block and first Transaction.  Likewise, Ash is 2, Jo is 3 and Kendall is 4.
